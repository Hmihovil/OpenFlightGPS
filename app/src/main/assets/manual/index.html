				OpenFlightGPS is an Android application developed to allow offline
				georeferenced
				viewing of
				various FAA products. The products are
				minimally processed in order to work
				with
				OpenFlightGPS. Therefore,
				the maps are NOT OFFICIAL INFORMATION SOURCES. ALWAYS
				consult
				official sources for aeronautical decision making. OPENFLIGHTGPS is
				NOT
				INTENDED for in-flight
				navigation use; your use of OpenFlightGPS
				constitutes acceptance of these
				terms.
		</p>
			
<div class="frame note">
<div class="label">Note</div>
<div class="content">Many cellphone GPS chips, and some tablet GPS chips, are not very
				accurate and may take a long
				time and a clear sky to get a GPS 'fix'.
				So-called aGPS (GPS assisted by
				cell tower position) may not
				be
				available in your location, or if you are operating without cell
				service, so OpenFlightGPS may seem
				to perform more poorly than other
				GPS applications. This is
				only a function of the hardware GPS,
				and not the OpenFlightGPS software.
		</div>
</div>
			
<p>
				OpenFlightGPS works on Android-powered devices, including cell
				phones and most
				tablets. We suggest that
				maps only be downloaded when
				the user is connected to the internet via
				WIFI, but 3G can be used
				in
				a pinch, as the individual maps are between 2 megabytes all the way
				to almost 20 megabytes, depending
				upon the particular product (such
				as Low Enroute, Sectional, WAC). Users
				may download individual
				maps as
				per the terms of their licensed version. The maker of
				OpenFlightGPS
				is NOT responsible for
				data charges you may incur from your cellular
				provider in downloading
				maps.
				If you wish to purchase maps in bulk format (DVD/MicroSD or similar),
				please contact us for minimal
				fee products we will send
				you.
		</p>
			
<p>
				OpenFlightGPS is developed on the open source Android system
				because we
				believe that vendor-lock-in endemic to some other
				solutions is not in the
				best
				interests of pilots. The FAA provides the
				digital base products for FREE, so
				we believe converting these products to a proprietary
				format and distributing them should be done 
				at a low cost.
		</p>
 
			
<div class="frame note">
<div class="label">Note</div>
<div class="content">You may notice some geographical distortion on various maps.
				This is due to the projection
				of the worlds (spherical) surface onto
				a flat map. This distortion is
				not seen on the printed paper
				copies
				because the paper copies do not preserve the georeferencing
				information that is encoded in the
				digital product as distributed by
				the FAA. The maps, while being converted
				to tiles, have
				georeference
				information preserved in order to provide the GPS features of
				OpenFlightGPS.

				OpenFlightGPS can show ownship position oriented in the direction
				of GPS
				movement, and gradually
				scroll the map to keep the ownship
				centered in the the view (moving map).
				Another option is to have the
				ownship
				display coupled to the 'compass' mode, so that the ownship
				will point in
				the direction on the map that the
				Android device itself
				is pointed.
			</p>
			
<p>
				OpenFlightGPS also displays a scale in the upper left corner of
				the screen in
				order to allow the user to estimate
				distances at any
				map zoom level. To the right side of the scale, the GPS
				coordinates
				in Latitude, Longitude and
				altitude (feet) appear when the unit has
				a GPS lock (coordinates will not
				display without GPS lock).
			</p>
			
<p>
				When the hardware gets a GPS lock, the ownship will automatically
				appear with a 'centerline' extended showing
				the GPS-computed
				heading, or the compass heading depending upon the
				mode selected
				(see below). If there is no
				GPS lock, the ownship will not appear.
				If not in compass mode, and a
				GPS lock is obtained but no motion is
				detected,
				the ownship will change to a 'house' icon.

				Simple, visual waypoints may be created anywhere on any of the Geo Referenced charts.  The waypoints are
				sequential, and we don't currently provide a way to reorder the points, so points must be deleted
				in order to insert intermediate points.
			</p>
			
<p>
				A course is a series of waypoints that may be saved or loaded as a unit.  Course lines are drawn between
				the sequential waypoints.  A course may be given a name.  Courses saved with an existing name will REPLACE
				the prior course of the same name.
			</p>
			
<p>
				A companion feature to Courses and Waypoints is the ability to scroll the current chart "off the edge", and
				if the user has previously downloaded the immediate adjacent chart, that adjacent chart will be opened and
				the previous chart closed.  This allows courses to span individual charts.
			</p> 
			
<p>
				Note that the course being viewed will persist through chart and/or product changes, and as such you can
				create a Course for example on an IFR Enroute Chart utilizing airways, then open up the VFR Sectional chart
				and see how the course appears on the Sectional.  Similarly, a course may be created on a WAC chart, then
				the course viewed in higher detail on the VFR Chart (or of course the IFR Low or even the TAC if applicable). 
			</p>
			
<p>
				Note that the Course will not automatically be saved.  In order to persist any changes you have made to the 
				course or the waypoints, you must select the "Courses/Waypoints-|Save Course" menu item from the Android 
				menu (when a chart is open).

				When OpenFlightGPS is started up, you will be presented with a
				Chart
				Chooser of your "home map".
				This is a user selectable home map.
				As shipped, the "VFR Sectional"
				chooser is set as the home map.
				Change the home map by selecting the Android "menu" key, selecting
				the
				"Preferences" tab, and going to
				"Home Map". Select the home map
				that you want to come up by default;
				close the preferences by using
				the device backbutton.
		</p>
			
<p>
				You can change the current Chart Chooser at any time by selecting
				the
				Android "menu" key, then
				selecting "Products" item, and then
				choosing the Chart Chooser you want.
		</p>
			
<p>
				Use a Chart Chooser by finger-pressing on the area chart you wish
				to
				view - the charts that are available
				(have been previously
				downloaded to your device) are
				outlined in green, and will flash red
				when selected. When you release the
				press, you may be presented
				with
				a context menu that allows a subselection, for example for "North"
				or "South" of the area.
		</p>
			
<p>
				The Chart Chooser presents a geographic area (United States) with
				"hot" areas that correspond to
				charts available for that area. Each
				of the chart sections (such as VFR
				sectional 'Albuquerque')
				appear as
				either a red 'X', a green slash ('/'), or a green outline. The
				red
				'X' means neither of the
				portions (in this case, 'North' and
				'South') are currently downloaded on
				your device. A green slash '/'
				means that one of the portions (either 'North' or 'South') are
				present
				on your device. A green outline
				means the both portions are
				currently on your device.
		</p>
			
<p>
				Either way, finger press the 'X', '/' or outline and you will be
				presented with a 'North'/'South' dialog.
				Choose which chart you are
				interested in and if the chart is not on the
				device you will be
				prompted to
				download it; otherwise, the Map Navigator will come up
				with your map in the
				center. If you do download
				a chart, the Chart
				Chooser will automatically update it's symbol
				('X', '/', outline).
		</p>
			
<p>
				You can cancel a selection by sliding your finger (before lifting
				your
				finger from the device screen)
				to a non-outlined area on the
				Chart Chooser and then lifting your
				finger.
		</p>
			
<p>
				Downloaded maps will persist until you delete them or overwrite
				them with a
				new version. They will persist
				through uninstall of the
				program. If you wish to manually delete the maps,
				first find out the
				location on
				your device by going to the Android 'menu' key and
				selecting the
				'Preferences' menu item. The preferences item
				'Data
				Directory' is the file path on your device to the charts. Each
				distinct chart is contained within a '.zip'
				file found in the data
				directory. You may use a file manager
				application to delete or move
				the zip files.

<li>Screen On in Flight - don't time out the screen</li>
						
<li>Ownship Centered - toggle to move map to keep ownship at
							center of display. Enables "moving map"
							functionality to keep
							ownship at center of display, causing the map to scroll
							with your
							movement. Note
							that repositioning the map by a manual scroll
							(finger swipe), or
							changing the zoom level cancels this function.
							To reinitiate after such a manual map activity, choose the "Keep
							Map Centered" menu item again.</li>
						
<li>Compass Enabled - toggle to show compass; also orients

<ul>
						
<li>
							Home Chart - set the chart type you wish to see first when
							starting
							OpenFlight Map.
				</li>
						
<li>
							Data Directory - this is the location where OpenFlightGPS
							looks for
							and downloads to it's map files.
							Only change this if you
							are sure you know what you are doing - you
							can easily change this
							and 'lose' your
							already downloaded maps, or change it to a
							directory that OpenFlightGPS
							does not have write privileges on
							so
							problems will arise. If your device is low on space, you can
							change this to a something like an SD card
							directory.
				</li>
						
<li>
							Screen on in flight - keep the screen from timing out. Note
							that you
							can burn significant battery by
							keeping the screen on too
							long. OpenFlightGPS will remain at the point
							at which you left it
							if you
							allow the screen to shut off - and you can just reactivate
							the screen
							(usually by a quick power button
							press) to get back to
							your map.

					Download maps by first connecting your Android device to a WIFI
					network -
					the maps are large, and
					distributing them OTA would be very
					time consuming - although it will work in a
					pinch. After you
					have
					connected your device to your wifi network, open the OpenFlightGPS
					application as you normally
					would, go to your desired Chart Chooser,
					and select the chart that you
					want to download. If the chart
					is found
					to be non-existant or out-of-date on your device, you will
					be
					presented with a screen that
					will allow you to download the map. You
					may open other applications on
					your phone while the download
					is
					proceeding, but don't "backbutton" out of OpenFlightGPS or the
					download will be cancelled.
		</p>
<p>
					You may force the redownload of a map that the device thinks you
					already have by going to that map,
					selecting the Android 'menu'
					button, then choosing the 'Force Download' menu
					item.
