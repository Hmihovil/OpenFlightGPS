	<li>Please use WIFI to download charts!  3G will work, but if there is any interruption
	you may get corrupt maps.</li>
	<li>Note new feature whereby adjacent charts may be automatically opened merely by scrolling
	off the current chart in the direction of the next chart.  As the current chart is scrolled off
	of the screen, the adjacent chart will be opened (and the previous chart closed).  Note that this
	feature works best on rectangular charts, and as such some of the IFR Low charts will not work
	well with this technique.</li>
	<li>If you download more charts than the FREE version permits, you must DELETE all but
	TWO of them to re-enable GPS features.  DELETE MAPS by: Open the chart you wish to delete from
	the 'Chart Chooser', then select the 'Delete Map' menu item while the map is open.</li>
	<li>Switch between different 'Chart Choosers' by performing a 'swipe' gesture in the long
	direction of the Chooser.  This will page between the various choosers (backwards and/or forwards).</li>
	<li>When moving a course 'waypoint': first tap the waypoint to move, then long press where you
	wish to move the waypoint to, then tap the moved waypoint and choose 'Move/Finish Move' from the
	context menu that appears to complete the waypoint move.  Choose 'Cancel' if you wish to cancel the move.</li>	
	<li>As noted in the User Manual, the quality of GPS in devices like phones and
	tablet computers is often not high.</li>
	<li>We strongly recommend using a GPS testing application if you are unsure of the GPS status.  The
	one we use is "GPS Status & Toolbox" by <a href="http://eclipsim.com/gpsstatus/">EclipSim</a>.</li>
