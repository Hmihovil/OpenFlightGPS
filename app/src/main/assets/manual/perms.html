<p>
OpenFlightGPS contains no tracking software, no advertising software and no malware or adware
of any kind.  It does exactly what it says it is going to do - download maps (with your permission),
and store those maps on your external storage, and optionally show your location on those
maps that are georeferenced.
</p>
<p>
Your cell phone or network provider may keep track of the downloads that you perform, and they
may charge you for bandwidth that you use.  This is completely out of the control, interaction
or knowledge of the maker of OpenFlightGPS.
</p>
</td>

<tr>

<p>
OpenFlightGPS uses a minimal set of permissions in order to allow you to download and view
maps, get GPS position and allow stopping screen timeout.  
Each required permission and why it is required is indicated and explained below.
