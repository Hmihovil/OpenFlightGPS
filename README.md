# OpenFlightGPS
Moving map aeronautical charts based upon OSM Droid.  Charts may be downloaded from within the app, or here are some sample chart packs.

OpenFlightMap was one of the first Android aviation chart applications served from the Android Market (Play).  It was soon succeeded by OpenFlightGPS, which added moving map and waypoint capability to the application.  OpenFlightGPS (chart subscriptions) was sold on the Android market for 2 years before being superceded by much more capable offerings from the commercial vendors.  At that point the app was offered for free until the Google Terms became onerous, at which point I retired it from commercial distribution channels.
